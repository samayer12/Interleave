1. 

The public files Plaintiffs received from the EPA Docket Center were copied by 

EPA staff onto a CD-ROM. For each PMN, the CD contains an electronic copy of EPA’s 

standardized PMN application form, filled out by the manufacturer. The application form

Case 1:20-cv-00762-EGS   Document 16   Filed 06/19/20   Page 30 of 98

contains a list of documents submitted as attachments to the PMN application. In turn, some, but 

not all, of the electronic versions of these attachments were included on the CD. 

2.  EPA staff either sent the CD to Plaintiffs via the mail or Plaintiffs’ staff picked it 

up in person. In some cases, Plaintiffs received the CD over a month after submitting a request. 

In others, EPA sent only part of the public files that Plaintiffs requested.  

3.  Such long delays impede the public’s ability to provide input to EPA during the 

public comment period EPA offers and before EPA completes its review of the PMN 

applications.  

4.  EPA has now announced that it will place PMN public files online at EPA’s 

ChemView website, https://chemview.epa.gov/chemview/. Yet, as of the filing of the original 

Complaint, EPA had failed to place any public file for a PMN application submitted before May 

2019 on the ChemView webpage, had failed to place several PMN applications submitted after 

May 2019 on the ChemView webpage, and had failed to update its regulations to reflect the fact 

the PMNs are now being placed on the ChemView website. Thus, EPA continues to violate its 

own regulations and thereby misinforms the general public as to the actual online location of 

PMN public files.
