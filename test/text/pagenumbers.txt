As a result of the 2016 amendments, if there is insufficient information “to permit 

a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the relevant chemical 

substance,” or if EPA finds that the chemical may (or does) present an unreasonable risk, 15

U.S.C. § 2604(a)(3)(A), (B), EPA must impose restrictions on the manufacturer “to the extent 

necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without 

consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially 

exposed or susceptible subpopulation.” 15 U.S.C. § 2604(e), (f). EPA must also regulate the 

chemical if it finds that the chemical “is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such 

substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial 

quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance.” Id. 

§ 2604(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II). 

25. 

To enable EPA to complete this analysis, the applicant must include in the PMN 

application “any information in [its] possession or control…related to the effect of any 

manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or any 

article containing such substance, or of any combination of such activities, on health or the 

environment” and “a description of any other information concerning the environmental and 

health effects of such substance, insofar as known to the [applicant] or insofar as reasonably 

ascertainable.” 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1)(B), (C); also 40 C.F.R. § 720.50 (requiring the PMN to 

contain “all test data in the submitter’s possession or control”).  

26. 

EPA is generally supposed to complete this determination within 90 days, which 

it may extend by an additional 90 days for good cause. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(c). 

27. 

As an alternative to the PMN application process, a person may apply to 

manufacture a chemical under the test marketing exemption in order to manufacture or process 

the chemical for “test marketing purposes,” subject to certain additional statutory and regulatory 

criteria. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(h)(1). EPA must disclose receipt of the test marketing exemption

application by publishing notice in the Federal Register “[i]mmediately upon receipt” of the 

application. Id. § 2604(h)(6).
