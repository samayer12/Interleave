1. 

EPA is generally supposed to complete this determination within 90 days, which 

it may extend by an additional 90 days for good cause. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(c). 

2. 

As an alternative to the PMN application process, a person may apply to 

manufacture a chemical under the test marketing exemption in order to manufacture or process 

the chemical for “test marketing purposes,” subject to certain additional statutory and regulatory 

criteria. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(h)(1). EPA must disclose receipt of the test marketing exemption

application by publishing notice in the Federal Register “[i]mmediately upon receipt” of the 

application. Id. § 2604(h)(6). 

II. 

Congress Envisioned a Transparent Review Process to Enable Public Participation 
in EPA’s Decision-Making.  
 
3. 

To ensure, “that the public receive timely notification of any new chemical 

substance,” H.R. Rep. No. 94-1679, at 67-68 (1976) (Conf. Rep.), Congress mandated that EPA 

promptly inform the public when EPA has received a PMN application, by publishing a notice in 

the Federal Register within 5 business days of EPA’s receipt of the PMN application. 15 U.S.C. 

§ 2604(d)(2) (“not later than five days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after 

the date of the receipt of a [PMN] … the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a 

notice.” (emphasis added)). The notice of receipt must: “(A) identif[y] the chemical substance…; 

(B) list[] the uses of such substance identified in the notice; and (C) in the case of the receipt of 

information under subsection (b), describe[] the nature of the tests performed on such substance 

and any information which was developed pursuant to subsection (b) or a rule, order, or consent 

agreement under [section 4].” Id.; see also 40 C.F.R. § 720.40(d) (describing contents of a 

PMN).  

4. 

EPA must then disclose the contents of the PMN application to any interested 

person. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1). To do so, EPA first is required to place “[a]ll information 

submitted with a [PMN], including any health and safety study and other supporting 

documentation” in a “public file for that [PMN].” 40 C.F.R. § 720.95; see id. § 720.3(kk) 

(defining “[s]upport documents [to] mean[] material and information submitted to EPA in 

support of a TSCA section 5 notice, including but not limited to, correspondence,”). Then, EPA 

is required to make the public file publicly available, both via request from the EPA Docket

Center; and by placing it online in an electronic docket for the PMN at 

http://www.regulations.gov. 40 C.F.R. §§ 700.17(b)(1), (2), 720.95. 

III.  Congress Enacted Limited Protections for Confidentiality 

 
5. 

In the 2016 amendments, Congress struck a precise balance between the public’s 

right to information about the chemicals undergoing EPA review and the information that 

manufacturers could claim, and EPA could protect, as confidential.  

6. 

As a result, TSCA significantly limits what information EPA can withhold as 

confidential from a PMN public file. First, EPA must disclose all information submitted with the 

PMN application to interested persons, except for information that meets the confidentiality 

requirements of § 2613. 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1). In turn, under subsection 2613(a), EPA may not 

protect information submitted with the PMN unless the manufacturer establishes that: (1) the 

information meets the requirements for a trade secret or privileged and confidential information 

under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); and (2) the information meets the 

requirements for confidentiality established in 15 U.S.C. § 2613(c). 15 U.S.C. § 2613(a).  

7. 

Crucially, Congress wanted the public to have access to information about the 

health and safety of chemical substances undergoing premanufacture review and, thus, provided 

that “any health and safety study” along with “any information…from a health and safety study” 

submitted with a PMN is categorically ineligible to be treated as confidential by EPA, even if it 

would otherwise meet the requirements of subsection 2613(a). Id. § 2613(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B).
