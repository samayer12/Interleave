However, EPA currently operates the new chemical program as a black box, 

denying the public information to which they are legally entitled. The public needs this 

information to provide input on the potential effects of, and exposures to, new chemicals and to 

advocate for restrictions on the chemicals’ manufacture, use, and disposal necessary to protect 

public health and the environment. TSCA requires that notice of EPA’s receipt of new chemical 

applications be published in the Federal Register within 5 business days; EPA routinely fails to 

disclose that it has received an application within the mandated time frames. TSCA mandates 

that EPA disclose to the public any health and safety studies and all other non-confidential 

information submitted in support of a new chemical application; EPA routinely withholds such 

information from the public. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to meet certain 

requirements before EPA can invoke TSCA’s confidentiality provisions to prevent public 

disclosure of information in the application; yet, even when the manufacturer fails to meet these 

requirements, EPA routinely withholds such information from the public. EPA’s regulations 

require that EPA publish the applications in an online docket; yet, EPA fails to do so.

Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to ensure that EPA complies with TSCA’s disclosure 

provisions and request that this Court: declare EPA to be in violation of TSCA’s disclosure 

mandates; order EPA to publish full and complete notices of its receipt of new chemical 

applications in a timely fashion; and order EPA to disclose all non-confidential information, 

including health and safety studies, supporting such applications. Plaintiffs also request that the 

Court require EPA to disclose previously requested information on new chemicals that EPA 

refused to disclose. Plaintiffs further request that the Court declare that EPA engages in a pattern 

and practice of violating TSCA’s numerous disclosure mandates and enjoin EPA’s black-box 

approach to reviewing new chemicals on a prospective basis. Action by this Court is needed to 

ensure Plaintiffs and their members have timely access to information and are able to provide 

input on the potential risks of new chemicals and the need for protections from those risks prior 

to completion of EPA’s reviews.
