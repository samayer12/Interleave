Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to ensure that EPA complies with TSCA’s disclosure 

provisions and request that this Court: declare EPA to be in violation of TSCA’s disclosure 

mandates; order EPA to publish full and complete notices of its receipt of new chemical 

applications in a timely fashion; and order EPA to disclose all non-confidential information, 

including health and safety studies, supporting such applications. Plaintiffs also request that the 

Court require EPA to disclose previously requested information on new chemicals that EPA 

refused to disclose. Plaintiffs further request that the Court declare that EPA engages in a pattern 

and practice of violating TSCA’s numerous disclosure mandates and enjoin EPA’s black-box 

approach to reviewing new chemicals on a prospective basis. Action by this Court is needed to 

ensure Plaintiffs and their members have timely access to information and are able to provide 

input on the potential risks of new chemicals and the need for protections from those risks prior 

to completion of EPA’s reviews.
