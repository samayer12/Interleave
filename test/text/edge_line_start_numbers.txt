1. 

However, EPA currently operates the new chemical program as a black box, 

denying the public information to which they are legally entitled. The public needs this 

information to provide input on the potential effects of, and exposures to, new chemicals and to 

advocate for restrictions on the chemicals’ manufacture, use, and disposal necessary to protect 

public health and the environment. TSCA requires that notice of EPA’s receipt of new chemical 

applications be published in the Federal Register within 5 business days; EPA routinely fails to 

disclose that it has received an application within the mandated time frames. TSCA mandates 

that EPA disclose to the public any health and safety studies and all other non-confidential 

information submitted in support of a new chemical application; EPA routinely withholds such 

information from the public. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to meet certain 

requirements before EPA can invoke TSCA’s confidentiality provisions to prevent public 

disclosure of information in the application; yet, even when the manufacturer fails to meet these 

requirements, EPA routinely withholds such information from the public. EPA’s regulations 

require that EPA publish the applications in an online docket; yet, EPA fails to do so.

2. 

Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to ensure that EPA complies with TSCA’s disclosure 

provisions and request that this Court: declare EPA to be in violation of TSCA’s disclosure 

mandates; order EPA to publish full and complete notices of its receipt of new chemical 

applications in a timely fashion; and order EPA to disclose all non-confidential information, 

including health and safety studies, supporting such applications. Plaintiffs also request that the 

Court require EPA to disclose previously requested information on new chemicals that EPA 

refused to disclose. Plaintiffs further request that the Court declare that EPA engages in a pattern 

and practice of violating TSCA’s numerous disclosure mandates and enjoin EPA’s black-box 

approach to reviewing new chemicals on a prospective basis. Action by this Court is needed to 

ensure Plaintiffs and their members have timely access to information and are able to provide 

input on the potential risks of new chemicals and the need for protections from those risks prior 

to completion of EPA’s reviews. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

3. 

This action arises under the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2619. This 

Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 2619, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and 28 

U.S.C. § 1361. This Court may order the Administrator to perform the requisite acts and duties, 

may issue a declaratory judgment, and may grant further relief pursuant to the Toxic Substances 

Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2619, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, and 

28 U.S.C. § 1361. Plaintiffs have a right to bring this action pursuant to the Toxic Substances 

Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2619, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 

5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.

By certified letters to the Administrator and the Attorney General—posted on 

September 3, 2019, and with return receipts dated, respectively, September 6 and September 9,

2019—Plaintiffs gave notice of this action as required by 15 U.S.C. § 2619(b)(1)(A) and 40 

C.F.R. §§ 702.60-702.62. 

5.  Where a manufacturer makes a non-exempt confidentiality claim but fails to 

provide a substantiation document to EPA, EPA is not authorized to treat the information as 

confidential and thereby withhold it from the public. 15 U.S.C. § 2613(c)(3); 82 Fed. Reg. at 

6522. If the PMN submitter does provide a substantiation document, the substantiation document 

must be placed in the public file. 40 C.F.R. § 720.95; 40 C.F.R. § 720.80(b)(2).

6.  Yet, for each of the 90 PMNs in Table 9, the public file contains redactions of 

information claimed confidential, without containing any substantiation document whatsoever. 

Many of the documents redacted from the public files in Table 9 contain information that facially 

does not fall within one of the § 2613(c)(2) exemptions from substantiation. EPA’s failure to 

disclose a substantiation document for these PMNs indicates either that EPA is unlawfully 

protecting information that is non-exempt, despite the manufacturers’ failure to provide 

substantiation documents, or that EPA is unlawfully withholding the substantiation documents 

the manufacturers did submit.
