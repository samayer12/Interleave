1. The allegations in Paragraph 59 state a legal conclusion to which no response is required.

relief.

AFFIRMATIVE AND OTHER DEFENSES 

FIRST DEFENSE 

The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over one or more of Plaintiffs’ claims.  

SECOND DEFENSE 

One or more of Plaintiffs’ claims fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  

 

 

Defendants may have additional defenses which are not known at this time but which 

may become known as Plaintiffs clarify their claims. Accordingly, Defendants reserve the right 

to assert each and every affirmative or other defense that may be available, including any 

defenses available under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 or 12, once the precise nature of the 

claims or events is ascertained in the future.
