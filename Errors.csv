Excessive heading,EJ34,"31. Virginia has adopted several categories for use in its biennial list of impaired waters. “Category 5” denotes those waters that Virginia has identified as impaired under 33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1)(A), and therefore identification of waters in Category 5 prompts the State’s duty under that subsection of the Act to develop total maximum daily loads to address the impairment. The identification of waters under Virginia’s other listing categories does not constitute an identification under 33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1)(A) and does not trigger the State’s duty to complete total maximum daily loads. 2014 Integrated Report at i, 2-4.

Excessive heading,EJ34,"43. Shortly thereafter, EPA approved DEQ’s decision not to identify the Shenandoah River as impaired. EPA justified its approval by claiming that “[t]he existing and readily available information does not provide EPA with a basis for determining spatial and temporal extent of impairment, including which portions of the River suffer from the effects of long-term substantial algal growth and which do not.” Letter from EPA to Melanie Davenport, Virginia DEQ at 6 (Sept. 23, 2014). Contrary to EPA’s claim, Virginia’s water quality standards do not specify a particular spatial or temporal threshold for identifying a water as impaired by excess algae.

Excessive heading,EJ34,"59. For all the foregoing reasons, EPA’s approval of Virginia’s 303(d) list was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” and is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right” within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).

Grouped Response,EPA34,"59. The allegations in Paragraph 59 state a legal conclusion to which no response is required. Paragraphs 60-64 consist of Plaintiffs’ request for relief, to which no response is required. To the extent a response is required, Defendants deny that Plaintiffs are entitled to any relief. To the extent that any allegation is not specifically addressed in the preceding paragraphs, Defendants deny that allegation. FIRST DEFENSE The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over one or more of Plaintiffs’ claims. One or more of Plaintiffs’ claims fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendants may have additional defenses which are not known at this time but which may become known as Plaintiffs clarify their claims. Accordingly, Defendants reserve the right to assert each and every affirmative or other defense that may be available, including any defenses available under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 or 12, once the precise nature of the claims or events is ascertained in the future.

Heading Parse,EJ12,"83. But Plaintiffs’ efforts have been unlawfully stymied by EPA’s black-box approach in which: EPA fails to timely notify the public when a PMN has been received; fails to timely disclose the complete PMN application, including all supporting documents, to interested members of the public; and abets manufacturers’ attempts to withhold information as confidential that is not entitled to confidential treatment under TSCA. In doing so, EPA repeatedly violates TSCA’s numerous disclosure requirements, thereby denying Plaintiffs information to which they are legally entitled. A. EPA does not timely notify the public when it receives an application to manufacture a new chemical, and the belated notices EPA provides are incomplete"
Heading Parse,EJ12,"90. Similarly, EPA fails to timely publish notices of receipt of test marketing exemption applications. EPA must publish a notice of receipt of a test marketing exemption application “[i]mmediately upon receipt,” 15 U.S.C. § 2604(h)(6), but for each test marketing exemption application received since the enactment of the 2016 TSCA Amendments, EPA failed to timely publish notice of its receipt. See Table 3. Instead, EPA took an average of 97 days to publish the mandated notice, if it published the notice at all. Id. Given that EPA only has 45 days to approve the test marketing exemption application, EPA’s lack of timely notice means that the public cannot comment on these applications. B."

Such failures by EPA are not isolated: in Table 7, Plaintiffs identify 94 PMNs where EPA failed to provide Plaintiffs with all versions of the PMN application; and in Table 8, 160 PMNs where EPA failed to provide Plaintiffs with any correspondence from the PMN submitter. EPA’s failures to disclose these materials violates its duties to disclose all non- confidential material in the public file that it makes available to interested persons. 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(3), 2613; 40 C.F.R. § 720.95.3.

Parsed Count,EJ12,"151. On information and belief: for the PMNs identified in Table 4, EPA provided public files to the Plaintiffs that failed to include health and safety studies submitted by the manufacturers. For each such file, EPA failed to comply with 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613 and 40 C.F.R. §§ 720.90, 720.95, which: (1) constitutes a violation of TSCA or a rule promulgated under § 2604, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(1); (2) constitutes a failure of “the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary,” 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(2); and (3) further establishes EPA’s pattern or practice of violating the requirements of, and failing to fulfill the nondiscretionary duties established by 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613 and 40 C.F.R. §§ 720.90, 720.95.

Parsed Count,EJ12,"153. For the PMNs in Table 6, EPA unlawfully withheld the safety data sheet, in whole or in part, from the public files made available for examination by the Plaintiffs. EPA’s failures to disclose the safety data sheet to Plaintiffs are failures to comply with 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613 and 40 C.F.R. §§ 720.90, 720.95, which: (1) constitute violations of TSCA or a rule promulgated under § 2604, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(1); (2) constitute failures of “the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary,” 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(2); and (3) establish that EPA has a pattern or practice of violating the requirements of, and failing to fulfill the nondiscretionary duties established by 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613 and 40 C.F.R. §§ 720.90, 720.95. Count VII: Violations of duty to make all versions of PMN available for examination by interested persons"
Parsed Count,EJ12,"155. For the PMNs identified in Table 7, EPA provided incomplete public files that contained fewer versions of the PMN and its supporting documentation than appear to have been submitted. Thus, EPA failed to make available for examination all versions of the PMN or supporting documents, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1) and 40 C.F.R. § 720.95. The failures by EPA to comply with 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1) and 40 C.F.R. § 720.95 for the PMNs in Table 7: (1) constitute violations of TSCA or a rule promulgated under § 2604, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(1); (2) constitute failures of “the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary,” 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(2); and (3) establish that EPA has a pattern or practice of violating the requirements of, and failing to comply with the nondiscretionary duties established by 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1) and 40 C.F.R. § 720.95.

Parsed Count,EJ12,"162. On information and belief, the manufacturer submitted a substantiation document for some PMNs contained in Table 9, and EPA’s failures to disclose the substantiation documents for those PMNs to Plaintiffs are failures to comply with 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613 and 40 C.F.R. § 720.95, which: (1) constitute violations of TSCA or a rule promulgated under § 2604, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(1); (2) constitute failures of “the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary,” 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(2); and (3) establish that EPA has a pattern or practice of violating the requirements of, and failing to comply with the nondiscretionary duties established by 15 U.S.C. § 2604(d)(1) and 40 C.F.R. § 720.95.

These failures establish that EPA has a pattern or practice of unlawfully withholding and unreasonably delaying agency action. Count V: Violations of duty to make health and safety studies available for examination by interested persons"
Parsed Count,EJ78,"185. On information and belief: for each of the PMNs identified in the first column of Table 4, EPA provided the public file for the PMN to Plaintiffs but redacted or withheld health and safety studies submitted by the manufacturer of the chemical. For each such PMN, EPA did not comply with 15 U.S.C. §§ 2604(d)(1), 2613, and 40 C.F.R. § 720.90, 720.95, which: (1) constitutes a violation of TSCA or a rule promulgated under § 2604, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(1); (2) constitutes an action that was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); (3) constitutes a failure of “the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary,” 15 U.S.C. § 2619(a)(2); and (4) constitutes agency action unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed.
